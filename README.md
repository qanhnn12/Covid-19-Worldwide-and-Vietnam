# :space_invader: Covid-19 analysis: Worldwide and Vietnam
This repository was inspired by the tutorial of Alex Freberg's [Data Analyst Portfolio Projects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f). Following his instruction, I already performed some EDA and created a Tableau dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/WorldwideCovid-19Dashboard_16710219069800/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). However, I would like to analyze other aspects of Covid-19 in the global scale and in Vietnam, then visualize them in Power BI since I've just learned it recently.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Preprocessing
The raw Covid-19 dataset from 1 Jan 2020 to 12 Dec 2022 was downloaded from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
Detail definition for each column name can be found in this [GitHub doccument](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/README.md).

After scrolling the CSV file for a while, I decided to divide my analysis into 4 parts: *Cases and Deaths*, *Vaccinations*, *Hospitalizations*, and *Tests*. 
Each one was stored in a corresponding Excel file. View all files [here](https://github.com/qanhnn12/Covid-19-analysis-Worldwide-and-Vietnam/tree/main/datasets).

## üßº Data Importing and Cleaning
Next, I imported 5 tables above to SQL Server. There were some numeric data stored as `nvarchar`, so I converted them to `int`,  `bigint` or `float`.
View the detail SQL script to convert them [here](https://github.com/qanhnn12/Covid-19-analysis-Worldwide-and-Vietnam/blob/main/data_cleaning.sql).
